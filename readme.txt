A plugin which only allows a post to be in one category by changing category checkboxes into radio buttons.

== Description ==

Only One Category makes sure users only select one category for their post by making the selectors radio buttons, which only allow one category to be selected.

Rather than spend all your time maintaining the editorial style of only putting posts into a single category, this plugin is a quick way for you to enforce that standard. It makes it impossible for a person to accidently break your site's layout of functionality by putting a post in multiple categories. They just can't do it, whether by accident or intention.

== Installation ==

Activate the plugin. Now you should only see radio buttons where you previously saw category checkboxes. That's why you downloaded it, right?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why use this plugin? =

The biggest reason that you might want to use this plugin is that your site is structured around the assumption that posts will exist in a single category. This makes it impossible for a person to accidently break your site's layout of functionality by putting a post in multiple categories.

If you have many contributors and don't have the resources for a thorough editorial flow with checks and rechecks, the plugin is an easy quick way to make sure your standard is maintained without taking a lot of time correcting mistakes.

= How does it work? =

Plugin live-swaps check boxs for radio button before the pages are sent to users.

= Are there any options? =

Not currently. If they ever make sense — if for example we were to add the option to use it one all hierarchical taxonomies — it may possibly get one.

== Screenshots ==

2. How it looks when you Quick Edit a post with the new UI.
